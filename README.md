# ⚡ C Core Fundamentals

### System Level Programming & Logic Building
**Maintained by:** Samir Raja (Panther)  
**Language:** C (Standard 99)

## 📖 Overview
This repository serves as a foundational archive for **low-level logic implementation** and **memory management** concepts using C. 

The focus is not just on writing code, but on understanding:
- **Data Structures:** Custom data handling using `structs`.
- **Control Flow:** Optimized decision-making algorithms.
- **Input/Output Streams:** Managing user buffers and CLI formatting.

## 📂 Modules Included

| File Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `Student_Database_Struct.c` | Manages complex records using Structure Data Types. |
| `CLI_Calculator.c` | Arithmetic engine with error handling (Div/0 checks). |
| `Parity_Check.c` | Mathematical logic to determine integer properties. |

**Note:** These modules are part of my early research into System Programming.
